## 🔐 Project Title
**Network Infrastructure Penetration Testing on Public IPs**

## 🧑‍💻 Batch Details
- **Batch Number:** G10 CS
- **Course Name:** Cybersecurity and ethical hacking

## 👥 Team Members
- Nadipena Varunkumar  

## 👥 Mentor Name
- Nishchay Gaba

## 📝 Project Description
This project focuses on conducting systematic penetration testing on publicly available IP addresses to assess network security posture. It involves identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in network infrastructure components such as firewalls, routers, and servers. The goal is to enhance awareness of potential security risks and provide actionable insights to secure systems effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform reconnaissance on public IPs using open-source tools.
- Identify open ports, services, and OS fingerprints.
- Detect and exploit known vulnerabilities in exposed services.
- Report findings with severity ratings and mitigation strategies.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Nmap** – Network scanning and service enumeration
- **Nikto** – Web server vulnerability scanner
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework
- **Shodan** – Search engine for internet-connected devices
- **Wireshark** – Packet analysis
- **Burp Suite** – Web application security testing
- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing OS

## 📌 Methodology
1. **Information Gathering**
2. **Scanning and Enumeration**
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
4. **Exploitation (Ethical Testing Only)**
5. **Post-Exploitation and Reporting**

## 📊 Deliverables
- Detailed Penetration Test Report
- Risk Assessment Summary
- Recommendations for Mitigation
- Tool Logs and Screenshots

## 🛡️ Ethical Considerations
> All tests were conducted in a legal and ethical manner, ensuring proper authorization was obtained prior to testing. This project is strictly for educational and research purposes.
